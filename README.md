Hi there!

Nice to meet u all.

I am a male asian boy high school F student studying in Hong Kong, born in 2010 and I should be 28dser hopefully.

As you are aware, Asians are known for their great sense of humor, and enormous genitalia, and respect for non-Asians, and for being polite.

Additionally, I think that I am known for my high EQ, good communicatinh skills among peers.
